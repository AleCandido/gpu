# OpenCL

It is a better option than SYCL, for the time being, since it has simpler and
more reliable implementations.

[Official specs](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) and
[SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK).

## Learning Material

While the official specs is for sure comprehensive, it is not very useful for an
inexperienced reader.

There is a good bunch of learning material on the web. Nothing really perfect,
but good enough and updated.

- [Official Guide](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Guide) as a markdown
  files repository
- [Hands-on Tutorial](https://www.nersc.gov/assets/pubs_presos/MattsonTutorialSC14.pdf)
  about OpenCL 1.2, but introduces most of the basic concepts required
- a rather brief
  [tutorial](https://ulhpc-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gpu/opencl/#opencls-target-audience)
  for University of Luxembourg students
- few [tutorials](https://github.com/gcielniak/OpenCL-Tutorials) with full code
  snippets

Also the Official SDK contains some code samples in the `samples/` folder of the
[prepository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK).
