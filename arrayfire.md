Native support for all relevant languages (+1)

- C++
- Python
- Rust
- Julia
- Nim

In-progress for even more: Fortran, .NET, Java, LUA, JavaScript, R, Ruby.

Ok, Fortran is in the wrong list, but if we have a C++ library or interface it
should be possible to use from Fortran, as written above.

Nice documentation (at first sight, still Doxygen) including Tutorials.

OpenCL interoperability, not SYCL. Native support for all back-ends, through
CUDA and OpenCL layers (built-in) and CUDA and OpenCL interoperability.

In principle support even for Xilinx FPGA, through SDAccel, but they say to
contact [Xilinx sales
representatives](https://arrayfire.com/partner-program/#xilinx).
